# What is this app about:

This rails app is a visualization of an API client gem for OpenWeatherMap.

The link to the API client Gem: https://github.com/hosseintoussi/owa

Also this project is hosted on Heroku: https://blooming-dusk-22771.herokuapp.com/

# To get started on this project:

- Clone the repository
- Run a bundle install
- run `cp .env.development.example .env.development`, and update the API key
- Start your rails app

PS: This project does not have activerecord in it as there is really not a need for a database at this point.

# Things To-Do to make this app better:

- An autocomplete dropdown for the list of countries
- Map visualization for the location that the weather is displayed
